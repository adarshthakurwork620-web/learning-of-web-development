Currently learning CSS animations 🎯
Instead of just watching tutorials, I’m building small animations and breaking things till they work 😅
This one is made using pure HTML & CSS — no libraries, no shortcuts.
Learning how animations actually flow, how timing works, and how tiny details change the whole vibe.
Still learning, still experimenting, but progress > perfection.
More to come 🚀
